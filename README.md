## What is this? 

This is an All-in-one program designed to make shell executable scripts for android. For eg in the above image you can see its moreover like a notepad, and the commands written over there are executed by TWRP in recovery. This is for TWRP but you can also use adb shell commands like cp, mv, etc. This are basic but if you know some advanced like working adb shell as root  ‘su’ you can insert your own commands over there.

## Notes:

Before using this tool note that I am not responsible for any damage cause to your phone, if you point at me I will laugh at you. For how to use this tool just watch the whole youtube video somewhere embed in this page.

Some Important things you should know before using this:

For using this tool you show at first know what is adb and its basic commands also must have a bit knowledge of adb shell commands i.e whole android terminal commands most similar to linux or ubuntu. Before writing any command in the tool you must start with an “su” statement at first, then write the rest of whole commands you want. In the tool I have differentiate Shell commands and recovery commands, this two things basically differs shell commands are using in android terminal while recovery commands are used in twrp, cwm, philz (in short storing commands in some cache and when you will reboot into recovery, it will be automatically executed), check the guide here. Also you can use our default shell commands for recovery scripts, eventhough there are some which may not work but still… And ya one thing for recovery shell scripts the line of execution differs while in shell they are executed in line by line wise, this is because actually they are store in temporary cache form. For more details try the example scripts in the Tool and watch youtube guide video.
